## First post! (1/26/22)
This first week I started the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp and began my journey to becoming a full stack developer. Web development has always piqued my interest since middle school from  linking random pages together with basic HTML to creating advanced and interactive profile pages from the Myspace days. Talk about a flashback! A few years back I worked with a development team to start an online business but now I've decided to take things into my own hands and jump all in to learn how to do it for myself. I'm sort of an all in or not at all person as you'll learn along the way.

Our first week has already provided some new challenges, especially getting used to the ins-and-outs of github. I initially took the Fall *Intro to Web* class where I learned bits and pieces of HTML, CSS, and Javascript just to get my feet wet. Now, I'm excited to start building on that foundation to become a full developer while building relationships and working as a team while in the bootcamp with those who have the same goals as I do. Hope you're all strapped in for the roller coaster ride!

I'll tee up a fun fact for the first thing to learn about me. Did you know, I have actually traveled to more countries than states? I love to travel and have been incredibly fortunate enough to see a few different corners of the world. I get a bit restless when I'm home for more than a few months without having gone somehwere new and am always in search of the next adventure.
