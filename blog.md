## It’s All Coming Together (2/11/22)

Week three is done and dusted. A bit more work than the first two and the first time pulling an entire project together using HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any hand holding. Our task was to build a simple alarm clock which was a little nerve wracking at first, but after moving through things piece by piece and finally getting items to work, it was also the most gratifying week so far.

We’ve worked on HTML, CSS, and Javascript mostly on their own with little crossover, but never altogether at once. This blog, while written in markdown, populates in HTML with a hint of CSS and allows me to convey a story, pictures, or maybe even a GIF or two. Working through all three elements though, you start to see how many different options there are to produce the same results. HTML being more of your basic formatting like trying to put the edges of a puzzle together first, CSS is putting what pieces you can together to look like the picture, and finally placing all the pieces neatly together with Javascript to complete the whole puzzle. Javascript continues to baffle me in how powerful and intricate it can be. It’s really the motor behind everything and provides a lot of the user interactivity where you can create or modify designs, make calculations, kick off events, sounds, you name it, it can do it. I take a liking to CSS since I enjoy the design side of things. Every website or app I use, I pay close attention to how it feels and works from a user standpoint. Does it catch the eye? Is it easy to navigate? Does it pull me in to want to use the site?

At the end of the day, I’m simply impressed at all of the different paths to a destination and how much of an art programming can be. I’m just excited to dive deeper into it and see where the journey takes me.

## Two Weeks In (2/3/22)

**What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**
<br>
While I know we have not touched on it much yet, Javascript. I feel I understand HTML and CSS enough to be able to navigate my way through creating something that looks reasonably well, but I am really wanting to bring more function into what I can make with HTML and CSS.

**What are you struggling with?**
<br>
In terms of the work we have been given so far, I don't feel there's anything I'm struggling with yet. There have been some additional small projects I am trying to work on in addition where you essentially need to create a project from scratch. Something like a Frontend Mentor challenge where you have an end result they provide you with and maybe some basic code, but you have to create that small project from scratch and figure out how to build it effectively and efficiently. Since there is no specific way to get to the end result, sometimes I don't feel like I know where to start and when/where to add the pieces needed. I imagine this comes with experience and figuring out your preferred workflow.

**How do you solve a problem?**
<br>
When it comes to programming, I typically try a couple solutions I know off the top of my head to see if it changes/fixes the problem or at least helps me understand my problem better. Then I can narrow down the keywords I'm looking for or the exact problem in order to effectively research my problem. I try to read or watch a few different solutions and find something that I understand best and follow to resolve my problem. Maybe I take something that already works to test it, modify it, break it, whatever helps me better understand how something actually functions.

**What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**
<br>
Often times going back to the beginning and reviewing everything I've just done step by step just to see if there's something small that I've missed or skipped. Far too many times there's something incredibly small that was looked over causing me to get stuck. I'll also just go occupy my time with something else to take a break from my issue since I've found myself thinking or staring at an issue for too long that I just can't figure out. Taking a step back and going into it again with a fresh mind seems to do the trick. My all time favorite, reverse engineering. I feel like there's so much to learn from taking something you know works and just looking at how all the pieces go together and understanding WHY they go together. If all else fails, I'm going to someone who knows more than I do!

## First post! (1/26/22)
This first week I started the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp and began my journey to becoming a full stack developer. Web development has always piqued my interest since middle school from  linking random pages together with basic HTML to creating advanced and interactive profile pages from the Myspace days. Talk about a flashback! A few years back I worked with a development team to start an online business but now I've decided to take things into my own hands and jump all in to learn how to do it for myself. I'm sort of an all in or not at all person as you'll learn along the way.

>Why tiptoe through life to arrive safely at death?

Our first week has already provided some new challenges, especially getting used to the ins-and-outs of github. I initially took the Fall *Intro to Web* class where I learned bits and pieces of HTML, CSS, and Javascript just to get my feet wet. Now, I'm excited to start building on that foundation to become a full developer while building relationships and working as a team while in the bootcamp with those who have the same goals as I do. Hope you're all strapped in for the roller coaster ride!

I'll tee up a fun fact for the first thing to learn about me. Did you know, I have actually traveled to more countries than states? I love to travel and have been incredibly fortunate enough to see a few different corners of the world. I get a bit restless when I'm home for more than a few months without having gone somehwere new and am always in search of the next adventure.
