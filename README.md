## First post! (1/26/22)
This first week I started the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp and began my journey to becoming a full stack developer. Our first week has already provided some new challenges, especially getting used to the ins-and-outs of github. I'm excited to really start diving into everything and putting together the bits and pieces of HTML, CSS, and Javascript more as a true developer would. While I have a little bit of knowledge and skill in those areas, putting it all together as one and working with a team while in the bootcamp will be something new for me and something I look forward to learning.

If you are reading this blog, you'll start to learn more about me and my thought process, but the first thing is a fun fact! Did you know, I have actually traveled to more countries than states? Well, you do now!
